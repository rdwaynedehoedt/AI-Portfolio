# 🤖 AI Portfolio

**Static portfolios are old news.**  
This is a next-generation **AI-powered portfolio** — a place where your experience, projects, and skills are not just displayed… they **talk back**.

Instead of scrolling through endless sections, users can simply **ask questions** — and the AI responds instantly.
